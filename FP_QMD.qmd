# Data

## Data Provenance

In this project, we use a COVID-19 dataset from The New York Times which contains cumulative counts of cases and deaths for each state. Then, since our file covers the period from January 21, 2020 to March 23, 2023, we can get the data based on the minimum and maximum dates. Then, because the values are aggregated from health agencies, they are made available as a CSV file on GitHub, which would allow us to use it.

## FAIR and CARE Principles

For this project, the NYTimes data is consistent with FAIR principles because it is widely accessible online. Since it uses stable identifiers like state names and follows a table structure, this would allow it to be combined with other data like population estimates for analysis. Then, the data is also findable and reusable because it comes from a good publisher with clear updates, which allows it to support questions about patterns in the pandemic. At the same time, it is important to look at CARE principles by realizing that COVID results show differences across communities. Then, since we want to avoid blaming specific states, we should focus on context like healthcare access and health differences. Thus, when looking at results, the team will frame the analysis to respect communities, which avoids claiming too much and shows how clear data can help public health responses.
