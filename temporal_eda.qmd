Temporal Exploratory Data Analysis
This section explores how COVID-19 evolved over time across the United States.
We examine weekly and monthly trends, identify possible waves, and compare the relative timing and magnitude of cases and deaths.

Weekly Trends

Weekly summaries help reduce noise and reveal broader patterns.
weekly <- covid %>%
group_by(state, week = floor_date(date, "week")) %>%
summarize(
total_cases = max(cases, na.rm = TRUE),
total_deaths = max(deaths, na.rm = TRUE),
.groups = "drop"
) %>%
arrange(state, week)
Weekly Summary Table
weekly_table <- weekly %>%
group_by(week) %>%
summarize(
weekly_cases = sum(total_cases),
weekly_deaths = sum(total_deaths)
)

kable(weekly_table[1:10, ],
caption = "Table 1. First 10 Weeks of Total U.S. COVID-19 Cases and Deaths",
col.names = c("Week", "Total Cases", "Total Deaths")) %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
Weekly Cases Over Time
ggplot(weekly_table, aes(x = week, y = weekly_cases)) +
geom_line() +
labs(
title = "Weekly COVID-19 Cases in the United States",
x = "Week",
y = "Total Cases",
caption = "Figure 1. Weekly total cases show major COVID-19 waves across the U.S."
)
Monthly Trends

Monthly data helps identify long-term patterns and major peaks.
monthly <- covid %>%
group_by(state, month = floor_date(date, "month")) %>%
summarize(
total_cases = max(cases),
total_deaths = max(deaths),
.groups = "drop"
) %>%
arrange(state, month)

monthly_totals <- monthly %>%
group_by(month) %>%
summarize(
monthly_cases = sum(total_cases),
monthly_deaths = sum(total_deaths)
)
Monthly Summary Table
kable(monthly_totals[1:10, ],
caption = "Table 2. First 10 Months of U.S. COVID-19 Cases and Deaths",
col.names = c("Month", "Cases", "Deaths")) %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
Monthly Case Trends
ggplot(monthly_totals, aes(x = month, y = monthly_cases)) +
geom_line() +
labs(
title = "Monthly COVID-19 Cases in the United States",
x = "Month",
y = "Total Cases",
caption = "Figure 2. Monthly cases provide a smoothed view of pandemic waves."
)
Narrative: How COVID-19 Changed Over Time

COVID-19 did not spread evenly over time.
By examining weekly and monthly totals, several clear patterns emerge:

Distinct waves: Both the weekly and monthly plots show multiple sharp increases corresponding to major national waves.

Early slow growth: Initial case counts rise gradually, reflecting limited spread and limited testing early in the pandemic.

Large mid-pandemic surges: Several large spikes represent periods when infections accelerated nationwide.

Deaths lag behind cases: While both grow over time, deaths tend to rise shortly after cases, consistent with clinical expectations.

Seasonal patterns: Some of the largest increases align with colder months, when indoor transmission increases.

This temporal EDA highlights how the pandemic progressed through time and supports deeper analysis of patterns and risks.
