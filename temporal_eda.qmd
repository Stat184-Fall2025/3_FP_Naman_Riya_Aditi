Weekly Trends

Weekly summaries help reduce noise and reveal broader patterns.
weekly <- covid %>%
group_by(state, week = floor_date(date, "week")) %>%
summarize(
total_cases = max(cases, na.rm = TRUE),
total_deaths = max(deaths, na.rm = TRUE),
.groups = "drop"
) %>%
arrange(state, week)

Weekly Summary Table
weekly_table <- weekly %>%
group_by(week) %>%
summarize(
weekly_cases = sum(total_cases),
weekly_deaths = sum(total_deaths)
)

kable(weekly_table[1:10, ],
